"Generic info:","The mode starts with one wave. That wave executes actions. These actions may then, among other things, spawn new waves.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Multiple waves can be alive simultaneously. The ”child wave” concept means that the spawned wave is attached to the wave that spawned it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Waves can kill child waves either automatically when the wave ends or via an action.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Wave tries to execute as many actions on every tick as possible. If an action is enabled, then it will be executed when its start condition is met.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The wave keeps waiting until the action condition is true, or the action is later disabled. Only after the action is executed will the wave try next one.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When all wave actions have been completed and there are no more actions to run, then the wave ends.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"There is also an end condition that’s evaluated every tick. If it returns true, then the wave ends, no matter what.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The starting wave is ”Main<name_of_pve_mode>”, so for example ”TestPve1” would start at ”MainTestPve1”.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actions:","None","Does nothing. Useful for adding wait conditions for moving on.",,,,,,,,,,
,"Spawn","Spawns the enemy given in arg string. Evaluates spawn count and then for each spawn evaluates spawn x, spawn y, spawn delay (in ms) and spawn level. If spawn level is 0, then tournament level is used.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SpawnFromTower1","Same as Spawn, but spawns are signalled to start from defense tower #1.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SpawnFromTower2","Same as Spawn, but spawns are signalled to start from defense tower #2.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SpawnFromTower3","Same as Spawn, but spawns are signalled to start from defense tower #3.",,,,,,,,,,
,"RestartWave","Restarts the current wave (does not end the wave).",,,,,,,,,,
,"EndWave","Ends the current wave immediately.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SetBaseXY","Evaluates spawn x and spawn y and sets their values into variables ’base_x’ and ’base_y’. Useful for creating patterns that are centered around a point.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SetLevelOffset","Sets the level offset for the spawned units (for all waves, offset is from level 9). The offset comes from evaluating ActionSpawnCount.",,,,,,,,,,
,"SpawnWaveChild","Spawns the wave given in arg string as a child wave of the current wave.",,,,,,,,,,
